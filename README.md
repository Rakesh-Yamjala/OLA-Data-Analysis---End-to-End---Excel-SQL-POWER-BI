## ‚úÖ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning (Excel)
- Removed duplicates and null entries.
- Handled missing data (imputation where necessary).
- Standardized date and time formats.
- Preprocessed categorical data for better consistency.

### 2. Data Storage & Querying (SQL)
- Imported cleaned data into SQL tables.
- Created optimized schemas for better query performance.
- Executed complex SQL queries for:
  - Booking trends over time.
  - Cancellation analysis by customer vs driver.
  - Vehicle type preferences.
  - Top pickup and drop locations.
  - Customer and driver rating analysis.
  - Revenue generation and high-value customers.

### 3. Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Developed interactive dashboards:
  - Daily, Weekly, and Monthly ride trends.
  - Cancellations vs Completed Rides analysis.
  - Revenue and payment method distribution.
  - Customer & Driver Ratings distribution.
  - Pickup & Drop location heatmaps.
  - Incomplete ride reason analytics.
- Filters for Date, Vehicle Type, Payment Method, etc.
